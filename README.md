Task 1 (To do list)

There is a set of tasks that awaits us every new day. Some of them might be interesting, and some can be tedious. However, the significance of completing these tasks is unquestionable, specifically in case they build on a regular basis.

There might be times when many of us struggle to keep a record of what we require. Perhaps some of us are in the habit of using a handwritten to-do list to remind ourselves of the pending things and their deadlines. However, handwritten notes have a higher chance of getting lost or forgotten. Since we are the Python coders, it makes sense to build a To-do list manager application using Tkinter.

Building a To-Do list application using Tkinter
The procedure of building a To-Do list management application using Tkinter is divided into several steps. These steps are shown below:

Step 1: First, we will import all the modules required to build the project. Step 2: We will then define some functions necessary to execute the application. Step 3: We will then create a main window for the application. Step 4: We will then add a database to the application to store the data. Step 5: We will add the necessary widgets to the application and apply the event triggers.
